There is no phone, but mobile reception is quite good, on Vodafone and O2.

The cottage is accessed from the lane, just 200 yards from Wern Road. 

The lane is shared, but the traffic is very light. However sheep may visit, they can easily be shooed away, but are inquisitive. Lambs are on the moor from April to June.

There is parking for two or three cars.

The open moorland extends for many miles over Halkyn Mountain, and although boggy in areas, is home to many birds and other wildlife.

Well behaved dogs are welcome at the cottage, but an additional deposit will be required to cover any cleaning which may be required at the end of your stay.

On the mountain, and throughout all common land areas, dogs must be kept on a lead at all times, to avoid them worrying the sheep, particularly when pregnant or with young lambs. It’s not that the dogs necessarily chase the sheep, but just the sight of a dog running is sometimes enough to frighten a ewe into panicking, mis-carrying or leaving her lambs.
For this reason also there is a 40 mph speed limit over the Common.

The mountain has been mined for 2 millenia, and evidence of this is visible all across Halkyn Common. There is a network of over 60 miles of mine workings beneath the mountain. Mining ceased relatively recently, in 1972, although quarrying still continues.
