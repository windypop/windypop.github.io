<p>The cottage currently has availability ranging from £200 to £350 per week.</p>
<p>As bookings may come in before this web page can be updated, it's best to phone us on 01352 781615.</p>
<p>Prices generally range from £200-£350 per week, depending on the particular week(s) required, and a deposit is kindly requested, to reserve the booking, which will be returned after the holiday. Payment for the whole holiday duration is required at the start of the holiday period.
Holiday weeks usually commence on a Saturday, between 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm - and run until the end date, again usually a Saturday before 11:00am. Different start and end dates are possible but may incur a slight surcharge, and other times are possible by prior arrangement. Please call to discuss this or other matters.</p>
<p>The deposit also covers any additional cleaning etc which might be required if for example, you bring a dog with you, and get caught in the rain! We can talk about this and provide further details when you contact us.</p>
<h2>What is included</h2>
<p>Bed linen for the main and small bedrooms; electricity for heating, lighting, shower etc. and all cottage equipment; parking for up to 3 cars; general assistance concerning the area.</p>
<h2>What you'll need to bring</h2>
<p>Toiletries and towels; sleeping bags (possibly) for the lounge chair/beds; wet weather gear (sadly we do get rain here too).</p>
<h2>What we could help with</h2>
<p>Travel cot and high chair;</p>
<p>If you wish, by arrangement, we can provision the fridge before you arrive - we can discuss this when you are booking the holiday.</p>
